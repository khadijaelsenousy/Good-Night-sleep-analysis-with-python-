# Good-Night-sleep-analysis-with-python-
Project Description

Sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Quality sleep repairs cells, consolidates memories, wards off disease, and much more. In this project, you'll be working as a data science consultant for SleepInc, a sleep-tracking startup, and your mission is to analyze anonymous sleep data from their SleepScope app to uncover insights into lifestyle factors affecting sleep quality and duration.</br>
the notebook will answer this question 

Which occupation has the lowest average sleep duration? Save this in a string variable called lowest_sleep_occ.

Which occupation has the lowest average sleep quality? Save this in a string variable called lowest_sleep_quality_occ. 
Did the occupation with the lowest sleep duration also have the lowest sleep quality? 
If so assign a boolean value to variable same_occ variable, True if it is the same occupation, and False if it isn't.

Let's explore how BMI Category can affect sleep disorder rates. Start by finding what ratio of app users in each BMI Category have been diagnosed with Insomnia. 
Create a dictionary named: bmi_insomnia_ratios. The key should be the BMI Category as a string, while the value should be the ratio of people in this category with insomnia as a float rounded to two decimal places.
